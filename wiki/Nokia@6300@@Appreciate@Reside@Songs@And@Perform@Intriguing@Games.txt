Jesse- I believed that the economy would have a bigger influence on our shows then it has. Music is a great way to escape a great deal of the stuff heading on in peoples life. I think now a times, people just want to be entertained more than ever. I have not truly noticed our crowds decrease, like I stated before, we give a ton of energy off when we perform. I believe individuals get their money's really worth at a Shurman show. As far as the Austin scene, Austin has the a ton of bands/clubs that do every type of music. Personally, I go to a bunch of shows about city and the crowds are fantastic, so don't allow the information scare you.

Although smaller sized than the Adventure, the Radiance experienced fine facilities such as the fitness center/spa, mini golf, swimming pools and the retailers. There was web access but at 50 cents per moment, the service is a little bit steep. There were issues to do during the times at sea such as art auctions, cooking demos and dance courses. Nevertheless, we felt that there was more offered on the Journey. As for embarking and disembarking, there was no issue on the Radiance. The 6th level contained the casino and for non-smokers, this was a issue. The air flow in the on line casino was not great and as a outcome, cigarette smoke travelled to adjacent areas near the casino. My companion needed to avoid going on the 6th level whenever feasible.

The night shows at the Aurora Theatre were a mix of the ship's personal crew of dancers and singers furthermore some outdoors comics and singers. In common, the exhibits were fairly great. We would have liked them to mix up the enjoyment each night instead than allocate songs, comedy and magic into various evenings. Instead than an whole show of magic, we would have preferred each night that includes a selection of enjoyment. Live Music around the ship was a nice added contact.
