The Roxy is a much smaller club than the clubs formerly mentioned, which can be really good. The room has kind of an fascinating established-up. It is a wide phase, placed diagonally, taking up about half the space.

There is a large open up flooring area, and behind that are tables and booths. It is an all ages venue, but there is a decent (although expensive) bar.

Stars such as Micheal Jackson, Elvis, Stevie Question, Joe Pesi and others have wax figures that much more than resemble them situated right here. Although the museum appears pretty calm and collective, loud screams and roars can be heard coming from the horrifying Chamber of Horror. It's right here exactly where scary creatures this kind of as Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolfman dwell at. Also beware when taking the children thru this part of the museum; there are a lot of gory and ugly displays of wax artwork.
