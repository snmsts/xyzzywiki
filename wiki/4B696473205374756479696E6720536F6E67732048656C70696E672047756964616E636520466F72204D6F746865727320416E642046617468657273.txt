However, comparing it to the larger Adventure of the Seas, we would price the bigger ship a little bit greater. We favored the massive promenade on the Journey which was not accessible on a smaller ship like the Radiance. Given a choice in the future, we would opt for the bigger ship. For first time cruisers, the Radiance would still be a great ship to vacation on. This is simply the case of exactly where veteran cruisers would expect more especially if they have been on greater end ships.
